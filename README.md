# SDFDiff_ImplicitFunc
3D reconstruction through SDFDiff algorithm with a new function introduced for testing to improve implicit value.

Implicit signed distance fields (SDFs) are scalar fields that store the shortest distance between a point in space to a model. The sign of the SDF indicates if the point is inside or outside the bounds of the model. 
SDFs are used to encode 3D surfaces with a function of position that returns the closest distance to a surface. They are emerging as an effective representation for 3D shapes.
